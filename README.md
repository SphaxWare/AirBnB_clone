# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

This project involves creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

## Execution

shell should work in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: ```$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash```
